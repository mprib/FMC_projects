Thank you for downloading the Dynamic Arm Simulator!

To get started: Click on das3doc_main.html in the documentation folder to open the manual.

You can re-build the manual by running build_manual.m in the documentation folder.

das3test.m in the realtime_model folder contains a series of tests that you can run on the model. If you run build_manual.m, you will run most of these tests as part of rebuilding the manual, but you can also run them one by one using das3test.m.

das3driver.m in the realtime_model folder is a graphical interface application that runs the real-time simulator and displays the movement in the OpenSim Visualizer. To run this, you need to set up the OpenSim-Matlab scripting environment: http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/display/OpenSim/Scripting+with+Matlab
Please note that you need to run Matlab as an administrator to set up the OpenSim-Matlb scripting environment.

Finally, to visualize the model in OpenSim, load das3.osim in the OpenSim_model folder.

Have fun using the Dynamic Arm Simulator, and let us know what you think in the forum at https://simtk.org/home/das !
