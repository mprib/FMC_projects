[2022-08-08 15:22:03.310] [cout] [info] Run a tool (e.g., Inverse Kinematics) from an XML setup file.

Usage:
  opensim-cmd [options]... run-tool <setup-xml-file>
  opensim-cmd run-tool -h | --help

Options:
  -L <path>, --library <path>  Load a plugin.
  -o <level>, --log <level>  Logging level.

Description:
  The Tool to run is detected from the setup file you provide. Supported tools
  include the following:
  
            Scale
            Inverse Kinematics           (IK)
            Inverse Dynamics             (ID)
            Residual Reduction Algorithm (RRA)
            Computed Muscle Control      (CMC)
            Forward                      
            Analyze
            MocoStudy

  This command will also recognize tools from plugins.

  Use `opensim-cmd print-xml` to generate a template <setup-xml-file>.

Examples:
  opensim-cmd run-tool CMC_setup.xml
  opensim-cmd -L C:\Plugins\osimMyCustomForce.dll run-tool CMC_setup.xml
  opensim-cmd --library ../plugins/libosimMyPlugin.so run-tool Forward_setup.xml
  opensim-cmd --library=libosimMyCustomForce.dylib run-tool CMC_setup.xml
