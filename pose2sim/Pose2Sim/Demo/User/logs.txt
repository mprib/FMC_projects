--> Residual (RMS) calibration errors for each camera are respectively [0.221, 0.235, 0.171, 0.191] px, which corresponds to [0.402, 0.445, 0.45, 0.505] mm.

Calibration file is stored at C:\Users\Mac Prible\Box\Research\FMC_projects\pose2sim\pose2sim-main\Pose2Sim\Demo\calib-2d\Calib_qca.toml.
Calibration took 0.05 s.
