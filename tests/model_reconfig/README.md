# Purpose of this folder

This will contain working copies of the tabular data format that will be used to update the xml files (model,scaling and inverse kinematic) to work with various tracked marker sets. This will provide me a chance to figure out what the inputs will be for methods that change the model files.

Anticipated needs:

- remove all muscles from an osim file (unnecessary for inverse kinematics)
- Given a list of markers, add them to a file
  - place the markers at the listed distal joint configuration.
